    // Gaze and pinch are the app's main input everywhere: the head aims, a pinch clicks, and a screen
    // tap still works too. In 6DoF, hand tracking (HandTracker, through HandInteractorRig) turns a
    // pinch into a click and also picks things up. In 3DoF there's no AR session to track the hand
    // with, so PinchSensor watches a plain camera feed for pinches instead. This runs it whenever the
    // app is in 3DoF and nothing else has the camera: it lets go of the camera just before 6DoF starts
    // the AR session, and waits k_HandoffSeconds after 6DoF ends before taking it back, since the
    // camera can come up silent if reopened at once. Pinching is always on: it's the app's input, and
    // a switch for it in the settings panel got pressed by accident, leaving only a screen tap to
    // switch it back. (The detector already slows to a few checks a second with no hand in view.) The
    // "pinch 0" launch option turns it off, for measuring its heat. It's for 3DoF only: in 6DoF, hand
    // tracking is part of what each demo asks for (DemoRequirements.Hands). The reticle turns
    // light blue while a hand is in view in either mode, so it's clear a pinch will register; and while
    // the gaze rests on a button with no hand in view, a hint under the reticle says to raise one (the
    // camera only sees about 21 degrees above and below the gaze, so a hand resting low can't pinch:
    // in the lobby a pinch on the settings panel's X once took 16 s to be seen). Put it on the XR
    // Origin. Logs [Pinch].
