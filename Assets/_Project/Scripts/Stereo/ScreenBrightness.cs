    // spare heat; the "brightness" launch option sets another percentage (0 leaves it alone).
    //   On Android this is the app window's brightness, not the system setting, and lapses when the app
    //   leaves the front. On iOS it's the screen's, which iOS can keep after the app leaves, so the
    //   user's own brightness is noted on coming to the front and put back on going to the background or
    //   quitting. It's also saved (k_SavedKey), since an app that's killed (by installing a new build,
    //   a crash, or swiping it away) gets no chance to put it back: started again with the screen still
    //   at this app's level, it takes the saved level as the user's. iOS still dims a hot phone
    //   whatever the app asks. (The screen never sleeps while the app runs: StereoRig sets
    //   Screen.sleepTimeout.) Logs [Stereo].
