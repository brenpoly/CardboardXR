## Google Cardboard SDK

Parts of `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Stereo/` are C# ports of the Cardboard SDK
(https://github.com/googlevr/cardboard), licensed under the Apache License 2.0:

- `PolynomialRadialDistortion.cs` — from `sdk/polynomial_radial_distortion.cc`
- `LensDistortion.cs` — from `sdk/lens_distortion.cc` and `sdk/distortion_mesh.cc`
- `ViewerParams.cs` — field layout from `proto/cardboard_device.proto`, Cardboard v1 values from
  `sdk/qrcode/cardboard_v1/cardboard_v1.cc`

Parts of `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Tracking/` port the SDK's head tracking, under the same license:

- `SensorFusionEkf.cs` — from `sdk/sensors/sensor_fusion_ekf.cc`
- `GyroscopeBiasEstimator.cs` — from `sdk/sensors/gyroscope_bias_estimator.cc`
- `SensorFilters.cs` — from `sdk/sensors/lowpass_filter.cc`, `mean_filter.cc`, `median_filter.cc`
- `Rotation.cs`, `Vector3d.cs`, `Matrix3x3d.cs` — from `sdk/util/rotation.cc`, `vector.h`,
  `vectorutils.cc`, `matrix_3x3.cc`, `matrixutils.cc`

`Assets/Plugins/Android/CardboardXRImu.cpp` follows the SDK's Android sensor readers
(`sdk/sensors/android/device_gyroscope_sensor.cc`, `device_accelerometer_sensor.cc` and
`sensor_event_producer.cc`), rewritten to read both sensors on one thread into a buffer.

Changes from the original: translated from C++ to C#, triangle strips replaced with a triangle list,
an iteration cap added to the inverse distortion solver, the sensor fusion's mutex removed (samples
arrive on one thread), and `acos` clamped when reading a rotation's angle.
